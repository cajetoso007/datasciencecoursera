The analysis makes use of the data available in the following Files:
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt'

'activity_labels.txt'

'train/X_train.txt'

'train/y_train.txt'

'test/X_test.txt'

'test/y_test.txt'

THe "Goal" is described below:
    The first method, extract_features, extracts the mean and stardard deviation in the dataset
    THen the X&Y training sets with the X&Y test are stored in test_data and train_data
    THe merged files for tain_data and test_data is called "data." 
    Finally, the date is combined using melt, then added to create a file called tidy_data.txt
    
THe Run Analysis:
    Add reshape2 and data.table libraries to the workspace to allow me to combine the data and store data as a data.table , instead of a data.frame.
    Load  test and train data using the read.table methods
    Load the features and activity labels.
    Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data using the extract_features method 
    Combine the data. Process the data. Test and train data done individually then combined.
    Merge data set.
    Create a new tidy.txt file
